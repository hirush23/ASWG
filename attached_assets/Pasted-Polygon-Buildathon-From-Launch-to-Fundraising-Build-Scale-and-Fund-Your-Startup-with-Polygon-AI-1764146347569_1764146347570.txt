This is not a hackathon. It's your pathway to unicorn status. Welcome to the Polygon Buildathon, a 3-month, progress-driven program where you don't just build a project—you build a scalable business and secure funding from top-tier VCs.

Polygon is looking for builders with bold visions, and AKINDO is giving you the tools, mentors, and direct VC connections to turn that vision into a funded, scalable venture.

🌊 Why Now? Why You?
The AI + Crypto revolution is no longer coming—it's here. From autonomous agents and on-chain LLMs to AI-driven DeFi and intelligent NFTs, this is the intersection of two exponential technologies.

And Polygon, with its low cost, fast finality, and growing global community, is the best chain to build on. The question is: Are you ready to go beyond a demo and build a business that attracts serious investment?

Polygon Buildathon Online Workshop

🔥 What You Get by Joining
💡 Scale Your Product, Not Just Launch It
Whether you're just starting or migrating an existing project to Polygon, this Buildathon is designed to help you refine, scale, and raise funding in 5 months, not 3 years. Our goal isn't just launch, it's sustainable growth and successful fundraising.

🤝 Direct Access to Top-Tier VCs
Top-performing teams get direct connections to leading VCs including Spartan, IOSG, DFG, SNZ, Animoca, and C2Ventures. No cold emails. No pitch decks lost in spam folders. Real introductions to investors actively looking for the next unicorn.

🎭 Demo Day on Global Stages
Present your scaled product at prestigious events including TOKEN2049, Devconnect, ETHDenver, and EthCC stages. Gain exposure to thousands of investors, partners, and potential customers in the global Web3 ecosystem.

👥 Polygon Core Team Partnership
Receive direct feedback, mentorship, and ongoing support from the engineers and ecosystem leads at Polygon. Build relationships that extend far beyond the Buildathon, with continuous onboarding support as you scale.

💰 Progressive Grant Funding + Fundraising Support
Get rewarded based on your progress every two weeks, plus dedicated support for your Series A/Seed fundraising efforts. We don't just fund your build—we help you raise your next round.

🚀 Focus on Business Creation
This isn't just about code—it's about creating sustainable businesses. Get mentorship on tokenomics, business models, go-to-market strategies, and fundraising tactics from seasoned Web3 entrepreneurs and VCs.

🏗️ 10 Waves, 5 Months, Dual-Phase Structure
Phase 1: Sprint to Funding (Wave 1–5, 2.5 months)
The first phase is your sprint to secure initial funding. Choose your theme and execute:

Foundation & Setup (Wave 1–2): Polygon integration, technical setup, product-market fit validation
Build & Optimize (Wave 3–4): Feature development, user acquisition, business model refinement
Pitch & Raise (Wave 5): Demo presentation, VC meetings, funding round execution Goal: Secure your first funding round within 2.5 months
Phase 2: Scale & Expand (Wave 6–10, 2.5 months)
Based on your Phase 1 results and funding success, we'll determine your Phase 2 strategy:

Continue your current theme with expanded scope and budget
Pivot to a new theme (AI, DeFi, or Infrastructure) with fresh opportunities
Scale across multiple themes with your proven track record
Your Phase 2 path, budget allocation, and timeline will be customized based on your Phase 1 performance and funding outcomes.

Each Wave is a 14-day build cycle focused on measurable business metrics and scaling milestones. Every submission gets feedback. Phase 1 success determines your Phase 2 opportunity.

💫 Build in High-Growth Verticals
Focus on AI, DeFi, or Infrastructure—the three themes driving the most VC interest and user adoption:

🤖 AI + Crypto
Autonomous AI agents that trade, analyze, or create
Prediction markets driven by AI intelligence
Smart NFTs that learn or evolve over time
On-chain ML platforms and inference layers
💸 DeFi Innovation
AI-augmented DeFi strategies and yield tools
Next-gen lending, trading, and asset management
Cross-chain liquidity and yield optimization
🌐 Infrastructure
Decentralized data/model marketplaces
Developer tooling and enterprise solutions
Scalability and interoperability solutions
Integrate Polygon into your product and make it the best version possible.

⚡ Who Should Join?
🆕 New teams with unicorn ambitions: No prior product needed, just bold vision
🔄 Existing projects seeking scale: Migrate and expand to Polygon for serious growth
🧪 AI x Crypto innovators: Test new frontiers with real users and investor backing
🧑‍🎓 Serious builders: Solo hackers, researchers, teams—if you ship and want to scale, you belong here
This Buildathon is designed for entrepreneurs, not just developers.

✨ What Happens After the Buildathon?
The best projects don't end here, they scale exponentially. We'll help you:

Secure Series A/Seed funding from our VC network
Grow your user base with Polygon's ecosystem support
Build strategic partnerships within the Polygon network
Access ongoing mentorship and advisory support
Continue scaling with future program iterations
Polygon is committed to creating unicorns, and so are we.
